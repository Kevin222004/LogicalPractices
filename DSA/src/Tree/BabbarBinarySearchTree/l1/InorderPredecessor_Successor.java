inorder of bst is always sorted array

for example of tree if inorder is 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17
then the pre-order predecessor 11 -> 10  (inorder predecessor -> maximum value of left subtree of that node)
     the pre-order successor   2 -> 4    (inorder successor -> minimum value of right subtree )
